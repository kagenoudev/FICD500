# FICD500

**FICD** stands for Fake Indian Currency Detection. The project was initiated with the aim of developing a system capable of detecting counterfeit Nepali currency (NRs) solely based on its image. However, due to limited availability of a diverse and reliable dataset for Nepali currency, i faced challenges in training the model and achieving satisfactory accuracy.

To overcome these challenges, i decided to focus on the Indian Rupee (INR) 500 currency, which has a dataset of higher quality and quantity. By shifting our attention to this dataset, i aimed to leverage the available resources and improve the accuracy of our currency detection system.

Although the project initially targeted Nepali currency, the transition to the INR 500 dataset enables us to develop a more robust and accurate fake currency detection model. We believe that the lessons learned from this project will contribute to future efforts in developing similar systems for other currencies as well.

Please note that the project is still under development, and further updates will be shared as we make progress. We appreciate your interest and support in our pursuit of creating an effective counterfeit currency detection solution.

For more information and updates, kindly refer to the project repository and documentation. Application version for iOS and Android are still currently development. Whereas web version will be live under few days.
