# FICD500
FICD stands for Fake Indian Currency Detection. The project was initiated to create a system which can detect if a Nepali Currency NRs is fake or real just by its picture. However, due to lack of the dataset we were unable to train the model and get proper accuracy. So, we switched to INR 500 as it was the best currency dataset related to Nepal.
